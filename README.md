# Packet39-VRCraneSimulator-Team2

A virtual reality project created by Daniel Sharvaaya Dash, Jason Banks, Justin Taylor, and Mark Tony, as part of [XRTerra's AR & VR Developer Program](https://xrterra.com/programs/developer/), in association with [Packet39](https://packet39.com/).

## Description

This application creates a virtual reality simulation to help people learn how to use a crane. It involves using a lever and button-based control panel within the application to control the different movements of the crane.
The application can be used on the Oculus Quest w/ Link.

  * Update Quest firmware (to version 11.0 or higher) and Oculus App on PC (to version 1.43 or higher)
  * Once all prerequisites are satisfied:
    1. Launch the Oculus app on PC.
    2. Turn on the Quest.
    3. Plug the Link cable into a USB 3.0 port on the PC, then plug the other end into the headset.
    4. If prompted with ‘Allow access to data’, select Deny.
    5. Next, there will be a prompt to Enable Oculus Link (beta), select Enable to begin remote rendering via Oculus Link.
    6. Open the project in Unity.
